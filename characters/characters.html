                    <p>The prince of Ylisse and descendant of the Hero-King. While of noble blood, he also leads a militia known as the Shepherds. His strong conviction makes him a fine captain. The most likely to break things.</p>

                    <p>A traveler who remembers nothing prior to being found by the wayside. Chrom realized your tactical genius and enlisted you in the Shepherds, where you are well liked. The biggest mystery of the group.</p>

                    <p>Chrom's tomboyish little sister, the princess of Ylisse. With nary an ounce of nobility in her personality, she is among the most likeable and approachable of the Shepherds. The girl most likely to snort.</p>

                    <p>Holy ruler of Ylisse, and older sister of Chrom and Lissa. An extremely gentle and kind person, who believes in peaceful negotiation even when her kingdom is threatened by invasion by Plegia</p>

                <div class='character-text'>
                    <p>Chrom's lieutenant, an Ylissean knight who is sincere to a fault. He tends to demand tremendous effort for seemingly trivial things, and prefaces such experiences with a grin. The fondest of starting fires.</p>
